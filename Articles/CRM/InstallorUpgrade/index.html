During an install of CRM, quite a bit gets configured.  Take a look here <a href = https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh699706.aspx>https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh699706.aspx</a> for more information.

<h3>Remote Powershell install</h3>

<p>for examples on installing CRM with powershell this page generates a powershell script that is supposed to perform the install.  <a href = https://public.agilexrmonline.com/AgileDialogs/AgileScriptsSLRunTime.aspx?orgname=orgd63594a3&DefaultProcessTemplate=CRM+Installation+Guide&lcid=1033&startpiid=decf9fe1096ee611940a7054d21aba07>Link</a>.  A word of caution,  I have not run any of the scripts and I would be leary to put any of my real server info into the form.  But at a minimum it will get you and example. </p>
