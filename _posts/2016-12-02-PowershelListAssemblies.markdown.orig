# List Assemblies loaded in powershell # 

How do you list what assemblies are loaded in PowerShell?  In the past I have had to troubleshoot scoping issues trying to determine if a specific assembly was loaded in a specific scope.  I finally found this as a way to display the assemblies.

{% highlight ruby %} 
[appdomain]::CurrentDomain.GetAssemblies()
{% endhighlight %} 


Enjoy
