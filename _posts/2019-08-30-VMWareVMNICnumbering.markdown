Applying host profiles for ESXi hosts is a great way to keep all systems configured the same.  You can routinely check for compliance to help prevent configuration creep.  One requirement is that all hosts have the same uplinks configured on the same physical nics, VMNICs.  Easy enough, but how do you know which one is VMNIC0, etc.  VMWare has a great article on how this is calculated.

Excellent to remember.

That is all.
