Happy Thanksgiving everyone!

I recently ran into an issue where the powershell execution policy of the computer I was working on was set to restricted.  Meaning I could not run any scripts to gather information I needed to troubleshoot an issue.

Fortunately, I found this article by Scott Sutherland

Very helpful

Thank you Scott

Enjoy
